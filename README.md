# sunburstR

Easily make these interactive `d3.js` sequence sunburst charts in `R` modeled on this [example](http://bl.ocks.org/kerryrodden/7090426) from Kerry Rodden.  For more details, see this post [Week 26 | sunburstR](http://www.buildingwidgets.com/blog/2015/7/2/week-26-sunburstr) from the BuildingWidgets blog.

### Examples

See the [examples](https://github.com/timelyportfolio/sunburstR/tree/master/inst/examples).

### Improve/Iterate

These are still far from feature-complete.  I would love your input, feedback, and comments.
